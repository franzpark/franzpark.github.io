### Objectives

When you finish this course, you should understand:

- Blockchain and distributed ledger systems in a business environment
- Important concepts and key use cases of blockchain for business
- How assets can be transferred in a blockchain network



### Terms

The system of record for a business: **Ledger**

An asset transfer onto or off the ledger: **Transaction**

The conditions under which the transaction must occur: **Contract**

A trusted, distributed ledger with shared business processes: **Blockchain**



**What's the one significant problem with traditional business networks?**

A: Every participant has a separate copy of the ledger and updates it for their transactions.



### The problems with traditional networks

Banks and retailers must update their own copies of the ledger, which duplicates effort: **Inefficient**

Some Banks spend about 20% of their resources running internal and external audits: **Expensive**

A retail store clerk inputs the wrong value for an clothing item: **Vulnerable**



### Relation to Bitcoin

**Blockchain for business** differs in key areas:

- *Identity* over anonymity
- *Selective endorsement* over proof of work
- *Assets* over cryptocurrency



### Requirements of blockchain for business

1. Shared ledger
2. Smart contract
3. Privacy
4. Trust



### Apply blockchain to business

Blockchain for business has several advantages:

- Saves time
- Removes cost
- Reduces risk
- Increases trust



## Four Examples

### 1 Consensus: Shared Reference Data Example

**What**

- Competitors/collaborators in a business network need to share reference data, e.g. bank routing codes
- Each member maintains their own codes, and forwards changes to a central authority for collection and distribution
- An information subset can be owned by organisations

**How**

- Each participant maintains their own codes within a Blockchain network
- Blockchain creates single view of entire dataset

**Benefits**

1. Consolidated, consistent dataset reduces errors
2. Near real-time access to reference data
3. Naturally supports code editing and routing code transfers between participants



### 2 Provenance: Supply Chain Example

**What**

- Provenance of each component part in complex system hart to track
- Manufacturer, production date, batch and even the manufacturing machine program

**How**

- Blockchain holds complete provenance details of each component part
- Accessible by each manufacturer in the production process, the aircraft owners, maintainers and government regulators

**Benefits**

1. Trust increased, no authority "owns" provenance
2. Improvement in system utilisation
3. Recalls "specific" rather than cross fleet



### 3 Immutability: Audit and Compliance Example

**What**

- Financial data in a large organisation dispersed throughout many divisions and geographies
- Audit and Compliance needs indelible record of all key transactions over reporting period

**How**

- Blockchain collects transaction records from diverse set of financial systems
- Append-only and tamperproof qualities create high confidence financial audit trail
- Privacy features to ensure authorised user access

**Benefits**

1. Lowers cost of audit and regulatory compliance
2. Provides "seek and find" access to auditors and regulators
3. Changes nature of compliance from passive to active



### 4 Finality: Letter of Credit Example

**What**

- Bank handling letters of credit (LOC) wants to offer them to a wider range of clients including startups
- Currently constrained by costs & the time to execute

**How**

- Blockchain provides common ledger for letters of credit
- Allows all counter-parties to have the same validated record of transaction and fulfillment

**Benefit**

1. Increase speed of execution (less than 1 day)
2. Vastly reduced cost
3. Reduced risk, e.g. currency fluctuations
4. Value added services, e.g. Incremental payment
